## 🎯 How to Use GSM

### Starting Your Server

Click on your server from the list, then hit the big green **"Start"** button. Wait about 30 seconds and you're online!

### Stopping Your Server

Just click the red **"Stop"** button. It's that simple!

### Connecting to Your Server

**For You (on the same computer):**

- Use `localhost` in your game
- Example: `localhost:25565` for Minecraft

**For Friends:**

- They need your public IP address and the port number
- Find these on your server details page
- You might need to set up port forwarding on your router (GSM will try to do this automatically!)

### Changing Server Settings

1. Make sure your server is **stopped** first
2. Click on your server to open the details
3. Go to the **"Settings"** tab
4. Change what you want (player limit, server name, etc.)
5. Click **"Save"** and restart your server

### Finding Your Server Files

Need to add mods or plugins? Click the **"Open Folder"** button on your server page - that's where all your server files live!

## 💾 Where Are My Server Files?

GSM keeps all your server files organized in one place:

- **Windows**: Check your AppData folder (GSM can open it for you!)
- **Mac**: In your Library/Application Support folder
- **Linux**: In your .config folder

**Don't worry about finding these!** Just click the **"Open Folder"** button in GSM to go straight to your server files.

### Backing Up Your Servers

Want to backup your worlds/saves? Just copy the server folder to a safe place like a USB drive or cloud storage. Your server files are safe even if you uninstall GSM!

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How do I create a new server?**  
A: Click the "Add Server" button, pick your game, give it a name, and click Create! GSM handles all the complicated stuff automatically.

**Q: Why won't my server start?**  
A: Usually it's because:

- Another program is using the same port (try a different port number)
- You don't have Java installed (needed for Minecraft - GSM will tell you)
- Something went wrong during setup (try creating the server again)

Check the "Logs" tab in GSM to see what's happening.

**Q: How do my friends join my server?**  
A: **You (playing on same computer):** Use `localhost:PORT` in your game.

**Friends:** They need your public IP address and port number (shown in GSM). Your router might need port forwarding setup - GSM tries to do this automatically, but some routers need manual setup. Search YouTube for "port forwarding [your router name]" if needed!

**Q: Where are my server files?**  
A: Click the "Open Folder" button in GSM - it takes you straight there! Each server has its own folder to keep things organized.

**Q: What if I uninstall GSM?**  
A: Your servers are safe! They stay on your computer even if you remove GSM. You can always reinstall GSM later.

**Q: How do I update my server?**  
A: Stop your server, go to Settings, pick a new version from the dropdown, and save. GSM downloads and installs it automatically. Pro tip: Backup your world saves first!

**Q: Can I recover a deleted server?**  
A: Yes! Deleted servers go to a recycle area for 7 days. Check the main screen to restore them. After 7 days, they're gone forever.

**Q: How do I change advanced settings?**  
A: Click on your server, go to the "Config" tab, and edit the settings directly. Make sure your server is stopped first! Changes save automatically.
